First, make sure to examine [the docs](https://django-boilerplate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If that doesn't help, we recommend one of these 2 main channels:

- If your issue is related to Django + something else but was generated with django-boilerplate, the best is to post a question on 
    - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/django-boilerplate) tagged with `django-boilerplate`, you would get more visibility from other communities as well.
- Start [a discussion](https://github.com/devxhub/django-boilerplate/discussions) on our project's GitHub.
